# Scripts

> My old `~/.local/bin` 

## How to use

Just add this directory to PATH in your `.bashrc` and all scripts here can be used as a script in ~/.local/bin

```sh
export PATH="$HOME/.local/scripts:$PATH"
```

## Why?

I created several scripts directly in the bin, which got mixed up with applications that also put their executables there. Furthermore, the scripts were being versioned in a dotfile repository called Labophase, but as it had many personal things there was no way to make it public. Because of this, starting with this repository, I intend to set up a versioning system distributed across multiple repositories, so that they work separately or together, keeping private information in a single place (I intend to create and maintain a template for this repository). In the end, even if no one finds or uses these scripts in the end, I want to make them available to the community, may free software live in these dark times.
